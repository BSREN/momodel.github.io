### What is dataset
Data sets are essential in machine learning and it is the source of knowledge.  Usually the data sets we are talking about are collected for specific tasks, such as historical weather data for a region, traffic data for a city, historical transaction data for a stock market, capacity data for a factory, and so on. Your every move also produces data, such as your consumption record. Data is common, but it often needs to be collected with care.
### Explore dataset
From daily weather data to brain nerve data, our website has included many different types of data sets. Some of these data sets are publicly released from research institutions or government agencies, and many are shared by enthusiasts like you. You can find them on the explore page and then browse through the details page. Come and search for interesting data sets. If you find it interesting or helpful, don't forget to give it a star.
### Upload your dataset
Of course, if you have some interesting or fun data sets yourself, you are welcome to share them. Maybe your data can help others and make the world a better place. Sharing data is very simple, create a new dataset project, upload your data, we will upload your data to the IPFS system after you confirm the release, so that fans around the world can see your data. Share your data and let us build a data library together.
### Work on your dataset
Maybe you are a newbie, you want to explore the beauty of the data, or you are an expert, you want to explore the treasures of data, you can easily process data, analyze data, and model on our website. Create a module project, introduce your favorite data set, and start your exploration.
### Dataset crowdsourcing
For supervised machine learning, labeled data is required. However, a large amount of data is unlabeled. We provide a full-featured data crowdsourcing function, which can automatically distribute data to others for labeling. When the data has been labeled, we will automatically train your model. Now, create a project and have a try.
